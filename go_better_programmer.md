# How Go helped me be a better programmer

## Abstract
Go is a strange language. It tries to be as simple as possible but no simpler.

With its unique form of simplicity comes constraints -- constraints that serve more to guide rather than hinder.

Join me as I reflect on how Go helped me:
1. model complex interactions with concurrency
1. structure my code into reusable packages
1. build abstractions that makes code easy to test
1. force me to think about how to handle errors
